This repo is part of my tutorial I've written up on [How to test React components using Jest and Enzyme](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-test-react-components-using-jest-and-enzyme-fab851a43875). There are 3 branches in this repo:

1.  **functional-app** - contains all the components without any tests
1.  **unit-testing** - unit testing is included for Search and SearchResults components
1.  **integration-testing** - integration testing included for SearchContainer component
