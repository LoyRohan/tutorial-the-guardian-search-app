# tutorial-the-guardian-search-app

This repo is part of my tutorial I've written up on [how to test React components using Jest and Enzyme](#). There are 3 branches in this repo:

1.  **functional-app** - contains all the components without any tests
1.  **unit-testing** - unit testing is included for Search and SearchResults components
1.  **integration-testing** - integration testing included for SearchContainer component
